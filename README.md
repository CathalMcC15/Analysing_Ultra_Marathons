# Analysing_Ultra_Marathons

Order of notebooks
1. Prep1 #combining datasets and pre-processing
2. PrimaryAnalysis #converting splits to minutes and analysing patterns
3. RelativePacing #diving times by average pace to identify key stages
4. ElevationPacing #finding the gradient of each stage to see how they effect times, checking correlations
5. FinishTimes #comparing finish times between genders and categories, etc.. Also finding the stage with highest correlation to finish time
6. Average_Pace_Prediction #Using CBR to produce challenging average paces for runners
7. Prediction_Eval #Evaluating these predictions by comparing to actual pb average pace using root mean squared
8. CCC_Scrape #scraping the data for the CCC race, a smaller race which many runners compete in before the UTMB
9. CCC_AP_Prediction #Using the same method to produce an average pace prediction for the UTMB
10. CCC_Eval #Evaluating the prediction results as before
